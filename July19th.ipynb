    "This notebook demonstrates how to train a machine learning algorithm to predict facies from well log data.  The dataset we will use comes from a class excercise from The University of Kansas on [Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems](http://www.people.ku.edu/~gbohling/EECS833/).  This exercise is based on a consortium project to use machine learning techniques to create a reservoir model of the largest gas fields in North America, the Hugoton and Panoma Fields. For more info on the origin of the data, see [Bohling and Dubois (2003)](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/PRS/publication/2003/ofr2003-50.pdf) and [Dubois et al. (2007)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2006.08.011). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use is log data from nine wells that have been labeled with a facies type based on oberservation of core.  We will use this log data to train a support vector machine to classify facies types.  Support vector machines (or SVMs) are a type of supervised learning model that can be trained on data to perform classification and regression tasks.  The SVM algorithm uses the training data to fit an optimal hyperplane between the different classes (or facies, in our case).  We will use the SVM implementation in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will [explore the dataset](#Exploring-the-dataset).  We will load the training data from 9 wells, and take a look at what we have to work with.  We will plot the data from a couple wells, and create cross plots to look at the variation within the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will [condition the data set](#Conditioning-the-data-set).  We will remove the entries that have incomplete data.  The data will be scaled to have zero mean and unit variance.  We will also split the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then be ready to [train the SVM classifier](#Training-the-SVM-classifier).  We will demonstrate how to use the cross validation set to do [model parameter selection](#Model-parameter-selection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once we have a built and tuned the classifier, we can [apply the trained model](#Applying-the-classification-model-to-new-data) to classify facies in wells which do not already have labels.  We will apply the classifier to two wells, but in principle you could apply the classifier to any number of wells that had the same log data."

If `C` is too small then the model will not be good at fitting outliers and will have a large error on the training set.\n",
